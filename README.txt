What is grok?
=============

Grok is a smashing web framework based on `Zope Toolkit`_ technology.

.. _`Zope Toolkit`: http://docs.zope.org/zopetoolkit

Grok uses the Component Architecture and builds on Zope concepts like
content objects (models), views, and adapters.  Its simplicity lies in
using **convention over configuration** and **sensible defaults** when
wiring components together.  That means neither a configuration
language like ZCML nor a lot of repetition are needed to create a web
application with grok.

You can find out much more about Grok at our http://grok.zope.org
website.
